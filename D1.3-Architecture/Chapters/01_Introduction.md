## 1. Introduction

This deliverable establishes the comprehensive technical and architectural specifications for the FLEdge system, laying the foundation for developing and implementing an innovative hierarchical edge-based flexibility management ecosystem. The system aims to transform energy management across multiple scales, from individual buildings to entire cities, through advanced edge computing and intelligent decision support capabilities.

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The primary purpose of this document is to provide detailed technical specifications and architectural designs that will guide the development and implementation of the FLEdge solution. These specifications have been carefully crafted to align with the project objectives identified in Deliverable 1.1 and support the specific use cases outlined in Deliverable 1.2. This document serves as the authoritative technical reference for development teams, system integrators, and stakeholders involved in the implementation phases.

The scope of this document encompasses the complete technical architecture of the FLEdge system, including several critical aspects:

The Edge-Energy Management (EEM) device architecture and specifications, detailing the core component responsible for local energy optimization and management. This includes hardware requirements, software components, communication interfaces, and data processing capabilities necessary for real-time energy monitoring and control.

The Energy Management Node (EMaN) design specifications across three hierarchical levels - neighborhood, district, and city. This covers the computational requirements, data aggregation mechanisms, and decision-making algorithms needed to optimize energy flexibility at each scale.

Integration specifications between system components, defining the interfaces, protocols, and data exchange formats that enable seamless communication and coordination across the system hierarchy. This includes both vertical integration between different levels and horizontal integration among components at the same level.

Data models and communication protocols that ensure efficient and secure information exchange throughout the system. This encompasses both technical protocols for device-to-device communication and higher-level data representations for energy management and optimization.

Security and privacy requirements that protect sensitive information and ensure system integrity while maintaining compliance with relevant regulations and standards. This includes authentication mechanisms, encryption requirements, and access control specifications.

Deployment and scalability considerations that enable the system to grow and adapt to varying implementation contexts, from single buildings to city-wide deployments. This includes hardware sizing guidelines, network requirements, and performance specifications.

### 1.3 Relationship to Other Deliverables

This technical specification document maintains crucial relationships with other project deliverables, forming part of a coherent development framework:

Upstream Dependencies:
D1.1 "FLEdge stakeholder, business, legislation requirements and guidelines" establishes the foundational requirements that inform these technical specifications. The architectural choices and technical decisions documented here directly respond to the stakeholder needs, business constraints, and legislative requirements identified in D1.1.

D1.2 "Pilot surveys and use case scenarios" provides the operational context and specific use cases that the technical architecture must support. The specifications ensure that the system can fulfill all identified use cases while maintaining the flexibility to accommodate future scenarios.

Downstream Dependencies:
D2.1-D2.4 (Energy Management Tools and Services) will implement the technical specifications outlined in this document, particularly those related to energy optimization and management capabilities.

D3.1-D3.4 (Hierarchical Management Ecosystem) will utilize these specifications to guide the development of the multi-level management system, ensuring consistent implementation across all hierarchical levels.

D4.1 (System Integration and Deployment) will build upon the integration and deployment specifications provided here to ensure successful system implementation in pilot environments.

### 1.4 Methodology

The development of these technical specifications follows a rigorous, systematic approach designed to ensure comprehensive coverage of all system aspects while maintaining practical feasibility:

Requirements Analysis:
We began with a thorough analysis of the requirements documented in D1.1 and D1.2, systematically identifying technical implications and constraints. This included mapping functional requirements to technical capabilities and analyzing non-functional requirements to determine their impact on system architecture.

Technology Assessment:
A comprehensive assessment of existing technologies and architectural patterns relevant to edge computing and energy management systems was conducted. This included evaluating mature technologies, emerging solutions, and industry best practices to inform architectural decisions.

Iterative Development:
The architecture and specifications were developed through an iterative process involving multiple technical workshops with consortium partners. Each iteration focused on specific system components, allowing for detailed examination and refinement of technical requirements.

Expert Validation:
Domain experts from across the consortium provided continuous feedback throughout the specification development process. This ensured that the technical architecture remains aligned with both implementation feasibility and business objectives while meeting all identified requirements.

Documentation Standards:
We employed industry-standard modeling techniques and notation systems to document the architecture, including:
- UML diagrams for system components and interactions (VN: Do we have real UML?)
- BPMN for process flows (VN: Perhaps too much?)
- IEEE documentation standards for technical specifications
- Architecture description frameworks aligned with ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010

This methodical approach ensures that the resulting specifications are:
- Comprehensive in covering all system aspects
- Practical for implementation
- Aligned with project goals
- Traceable to project requirements
- Clear and accessible to all stakeholders
- Maintainable throughout the project lifecycle

The methodology emphasizes both technical rigor and practical applicability, creating specifications that will effectively guide the system's development while maintaining flexibility for future adaptations and improvements.

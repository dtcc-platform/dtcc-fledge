### 2.1 System Overview

The FLEdge system implements a hierarchical architecture for energy flexibility management, operating across multiple scales from individual buildings to entire cities. At its core, the system utilizes edge computing principles to process and manage energy data locally while enabling coordinated optimization across broader geographical scales.

The architecture follows a distributed approach, with key processing capabilities placed at the edge of the network through the Edge-Energy Management (EEM) devices. These devices interact with building systems and energy resources while maintaining communication with higher-level Energy Management Nodes (EMaN) that coordinate activities at neighborhood, district, and city scales.

This hierarchical structure enables local autonomy while facilitating broader energy optimization goals. Each level in the hierarchy maintains its own decision-making capabilities while participating in coordinated actions through well-defined interfaces and protocols.

### 2.2 Architecture Principles

The FLEdge architecture adheres to several fundamental principles that guide its design and implementation:

#### Decentralization
The system distributes processing and decision-making capabilities across multiple levels, reducing central point failures and enabling local autonomy while maintaining coordinated action toward global objectives.

#### Edge-First Processing
Data processing occurs as close to the source as possible, minimizing latency and network load while enabling rapid response to local conditions.

#### Hierarchical Coordination
While maintaining local autonomy, the system enables coordinated actions across different scales through a well-defined hierarchy of control and communication.

#### Security by Design
Security considerations are integrated at every level, from device-level encryption to system-wide access control and data protection measures.

#### Scalability and Flexibility
The architecture supports dynamic scaling, allowing for the addition of new devices and nodes while maintaining system performance and reliability.

### 2.2 Key Components and Interfaces

The FLEdge system comprises several essential components that work together to deliver comprehensive energy flexibility management:

### 2.2.1 FLEDge Building Level EMaN (Pilot Site Deployment/EEM)

Corresponding to the level of building areas, buildings or apartments, the **Building Level EMaN** includes all the necessary components that will autonomously and automatically manage in real-time local control actions and respective information. End User required interaction will be limited, while self-privacy and autonomy of buildings will be ensured through privacy preserving monitoring mechanisms and infrastructures. The Pilot Site Deployment will interact with the building on a continuous and real time basis, based on present building context (comfort and occupancy evidence or prediction, environmental context etc.).  

The **EEM device** serves as the foundational component of the system, deployed at the building level. It incorporates data collection interfaces for energy meters, sensors, and building management systems. The device features local processing capabilities for real-time analysis and decision-making, including a Decision Support System (DSS) for automated energy optimization. 
Various mechanisms will be deployed in order to assist with operation control and decisions during its operation.
Advanced algorithms and their output knowledge (i.e. building flexibility, well-being estimation, RES & storage status, etc.), will allow to analyse and evaluate the building operational status at real-time and make optimal decisions towards smart proactive building behaviour and services.
In order to securely distribute and exchange information and knowledge within FLEdge framework, External interfaces will be developed and integrated into Building EMaNs for secure end-to-end communications, data protection and privacy-preserving enabling communication with building systems and higher-level EMaN nodes.

### 2.2.2 Neighbourhood/District/City Level EMaN: 

EMaN nodes operate at three distinct levels - neighborhood, district, and city - each providing increasingly broader coordination capabilities. These nodes aggregate data from lower levels, implement optimization algorithms appropriate to their scope, and manage demand response strategies. 

They feature interfaces for both vertical communication (with other hierarchy levels) and horizontal communication (with peer nodes at the same level).
They also handle energy transactions across various levels leveraging blockchain frameworks like . Hyperledger Fabric's modular architecture and role-based node delineation ensure secure, efficient processing, while Energy Web Chain, tailored to energy-sector applications, provides a decentralized infrastructure optimized for energy trading and coordination. Smart contracts deployed on these platforms could automate transactions, authenticate participant roles, and ensure traceability, facilitating seamless, secure, and transparent energy management operations. 

FLEdgeâ€™s Energy Management Nodes (EMaNs), designed to manage operations at the neighborhood, district, and city levels, adhere to a unified architectural template. This consistent design supports identical functionalities at varying scales, utilizing aggregated data from lower-tier nodes to ensure grid stability and optimization. 

Each node is composed of three core components: the Prediction and Simulation Layer, the Decision Layer, and the Middleware Layer, which work together to enable efficient and scalable energy management.

### 2.2.3 Operational Platform:

Itâ€™s the central component of the FLEdge system architecture providing a secure, scalable, and adaptable framework for data collection, visualization, and user actions. At its core, the platform integrates a centralized data hub, advanced authentication mechanisms, and a multi-tiered visualization layer, offering dashboards and a mobile application for continuousn real-time monitoring and control. By interfacing with distributed Energy Management Nodes (EMaNs) at various levels, the Operational Platform facilitates seamless communication between localized energy systems and centralized functionality. This layer consists of the following sub-systems. 

 

#### 2.2.3.1 Authentication Layer 

The Authentication Layer employs a token-based authentication mechanism combined with role-based access control to securely manage user interactions with the system. Upon successful authentication through the mobile app or dashboards, users are issued a secure token which encodes their role and permissions. This token is included in subsequent API requests to ensure that users can access data and perform actions appropriate to their assigned roles, such as viewing historical energy data or interacting with digital twin models. To further enhance communication security, the system can incorporate mutual TLS (mTLS), enabling bidirectional authentication between clients and servers to safeguard sensitive energy data and ensure trusted interactions. This combination ensures robust, scalable, and secure access management across the platform.

TODO 

 

#### 2.2.3.3 Data Storage Layer 

The Data Storage Layer serves as a centralized and scalable hub for collecting, storing, and processing data from all nodes within the system. Its architecture aims to support high-throughput data ingestion and secure communication, with a focus on flexibility and modularity. Time-series data, such as energy consumption, generation, elasticity, and occupancy metrics, is efficiently stored in a system optimized for temporal data, while relational data structures manage hierarchical metadata and aggregated summaries.  

To ensure compliance with data protection regulations, the system could employ privacy-preserving techniques like data minimization, pseudonymization, encryption, and automated retention policies. Security measures, including encrypted data transfer, access controls based on user roles and node levels, and secure node-to-hub communication using mutual TLS, safeguard the data. The architecture is designed to be adaptable, enabling the integration of different tools and platforms as needed, to ensure long-term scalability and compliance without dependency on specific vendors.

#### 2.2.1.4 Data and Security Layer 

TODO 

### 2.2.2 Neighbourhood/District/City Level EMaN: 

EMaN nodes operate at three distinct levels - neighborhood, district, and city - each providing increasingly broader coordination capabilities. These nodes aggregate data from lower levels, implement optimization algorithms appropriate to their scope, and manage demand response strategies. 

They feature interfaces for both vertical communication (with other hierarchy levels) and horizontal communication (with peer nodes at the same level).
They also handle energy transactions across various levels leveraging blockchain frameworks like . Hyperledger Fabric's modular architecture and role-based node delineation ensure secure, efficient processing, while Energy Web Chain, tailored to energy-sector applications, provides a decentralized infrastructure optimized for energy trading and coordination. Smart contracts deployed on these platforms could automate transactions, authenticate participant roles, and ensure traceability, facilitating seamless, secure, and transparent energy management operations. 

FLEdge’s Energy Management Nodes (EMaNs), designed to manage operations at the neighborhood, district, and city levels, adhere to a unified architectural template. This consistent design supports identical functionalities at varying scales, utilizing aggregated data from lower-tier nodes to ensure grid stability and optimization. 

Each node is composed of three core components: the Prediction and Simulation Layer, the Decision Layer, and the Middleware Layer, which work together to enable efficient and scalable energy management. 

#### 2.2.2.1 Middleware Layer 

TODO 

#### 2.2.2.2 Prediction & Simulation Layer

By interfacing with distributed Energy Management Nodes (EMaNs) at various levels, the Operational Platform facilitates seamless communication between localized energy systems and centralized functionality. This layer consists of the following sub-systems. 

 

#### 2.2.3.1 Authentication Layer 

The Authentication Layer employs a token-based authentication mechanism combined with role-based access control to securely manage user interactions with the system. Upon successful authentication through the mobile app or dashboards, users are issued a secure token which encodes their role and permissions. This token is included in subsequent API requests to ensure that users can access data and perform actions appropriate to their assigned roles, such as viewing historical energy data or interacting with digital twin models. To further enhance communication security, the system can incorporate mutual TLS (mTLS), enabling bidirectional authentication between clients and servers to safeguard sensitive energy data and ensure trusted interactions. This combination ensures robust, scalable, and secure access management across the platform. 

 

#### 2.2.3.2 Visualization Layer 

Includes dashboards for different hierarchical levels—City, District, Neighbourhood, and Building—and a Mobile App interface for accessibility. These dashboards provide insights, visualizations, and tools to monitor and manage energy systems at their respective levels.

#### 2.2.3.3 Data Storage Layer 

The Data Storage Layer serves as a centralized and scalable hub for collecting, storing, and processing data from all nodes within the system. Its architecture aims to support high-throughput data ingestion and secure communication, with a focus on flexibility and modularity. Time-series data, such as energy consumption, generation, elasticity, and occupancy metrics, is efficiently stored in a system optimized for temporal data, while relational data structures manage hierarchical metadata and aggregated summaries.  

To ensure compliance with data protection regulations, the system could employ privacy-preserving techniques like data minimization, pseudonymization, encryption, and automated retention policies. Security measures, including encrypted data transfer, access controls based on user roles and node levels, and secure node-to-hub communication using mutual TLS, safeguard the data. The architecture is designed to be adaptable, enabling the integration of different tools and platforms as needed, to ensure long-term scalability and compliance without dependency on specific vendors.

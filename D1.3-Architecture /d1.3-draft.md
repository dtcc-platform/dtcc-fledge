## 2. Overall System Architecture

### 2.1 System Overview

The FLEdge system implements a hierarchical architecture for energy flexibility management, operating across multiple scales from individual buildings to entire cities. At its core, the system utilizes edge computing principles to process and manage energy data locally while enabling coordinated optimization across broader geographical scales.

The architecture follows a distributed approach, with key processing capabilities placed at the edge of the network through the Edge-Energy Management (EEM) devices. These devices interact with building systems and energy resources while maintaining communication with higher-level Energy Management Nodes (EMaN) that coordinate activities at neighborhood, district, and city scales.

This hierarchical structure enables local autonomy while facilitating broader energy optimization goals. Each level in the hierarchy maintains its own decision-making capabilities while participating in coordinated actions through well-defined interfaces and protocols.

### 2.2 Key Components and Interfaces

The FLEdge system comprises several essential components that work together to deliver comprehensive energy flexibility management:

The device features local processing capabilities for real-time analysis and decision-making, including a Decision Support System (DSS) for automated energy optimization. External interfaces enable communication with building systems and higher-level EMaN nodes.

Energy Management Node (EMaN)
EMaN nodes operate at three distinct levels - neighborhood, district, and city - each providing increasingly broader coordination capabilities. These nodes aggregate data from lower levels, implement optimization algorithms appropriate to their scope, and manage demand response strategies. They feature interfaces for both vertical communication (with other hierarchy levels) and horizontal communication (with peer nodes at the same level).

Decision Support System (DSS)
The DSS operates within both EEM devices and EMaN nodes, providing intelligent decision-making capabilities tailored to each level's requirements. It processes real-time data, applies optimization algorithms, and generates control decisions. The DSS interfaces with both local systems and external components through standardized APIs.

Communication Infrastructure
A robust communication infrastructure connects all system components, supporting both real-time data exchange and control signals. It implements multiple protocols to accommodate various device types and communication requirements, while ensuring security and reliability.

### 2.3 Architecture Principles

Local Processing Layer
EEM devices process collected data locally, implementing real-time analysis and control decisions. This layer includes data aggregation, filtering, and local optimization algorithms that operate independently of higher-level systems.

Aggregation and Coordination Layer
EMaN nodes aggregate data from multiple sources, implementing broader optimization strategies and coordination mechanisms. This layer handles data from multiple EEM devices or lower-level EMaN nodes, generating coordinated control decisions and flexibility management strategies.

Enterprise Integration Layer
At the highest level, the system integrates with external enterprise systems, providing data for analysis, reporting, and broader energy management initiatives. This layer implements standardized interfaces for data exchange with external systems while maintaining security and access control.

The data flow architecture ensures efficient information movement throughout the system while maintaining data integrity and security. It implements caching mechanisms at appropriate levels to optimize performance and includes redundancy measures to ensure system reliability.

At its foundation lies a robust message queue infrastructure based on Apache Kafka, configured to handle high-throughput event streaming with guaranteed message delivery. The system implements multiple message queues, each optimized for specific types of data and communication patterns.

The message queuing system is configured with a minimum of three broker nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Each topic is configured with a replication factor of three and implements appropriate partitioning strategies based on message volume and consumption patterns. The system maintains message persistence with configurable retention periods, typically set to 7 days for operational data and 30 days for audit trails.

To handle message routing and delivery, the system implements a sophisticated publish/subscribe mechanism that supports dynamic topic creation and message filtering. Publishers can specify message priorities and quality of service levels, while subscribers can implement message filtering based on content and metadata. The system includes dead letter queuing for failed messages, with automated retry mechanisms and error handling procedures.

##### Service-Based Integration

The service layer implements a combination of REST and gRPC services to support both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns. RESTful services follow OpenAPI specifications and implement standard HTTP methods with appropriate status codes and error handling. These services are primarily used for configuration management, system administration, and user interfaces.

For performance-critical operations, the system implements gRPC services with protocol buffers for efficient serialization. These services handle real-time data streaming, control commands, and system-to-system communication. The gRPC implementation includes support for bi-directional streaming, allowing for efficient real-time updates and command execution.

#### 6.1.2 Integration Layers

The FLEdge system implements three distinct integration layers, each optimized for specific types of communication and data exchange.

##### Field Level Integration

At the field level, integration focuses on connecting with physical devices and systems within buildings. This layer implements multiple industrial protocols to ensure compatibility with a wide range of equipment and systems. The Modbus implementation supports both TCP and RTU variants, with automatic protocol detection and conversion. Device addressing follows a hierarchical scheme, with configurable polling intervals and timeout settings.

BACnet/IP integration provides comprehensive support for building automation systems, implementing object modeling that aligns with standard BACnet device profiles. The system supports automatic device discovery and maintains a dynamic device directory. Property mapping is handled through a configurable template system that supports both standard and proprietary object types.

##### System Level Integration

The system level integration layer coordinates communication between different FLEdge components through a sophisticated service mesh architecture. This implementation uses Istio as the service mesh platform, providing advanced traffic management, security, and observability features. The service mesh handles service discovery, load balancing, and circuit breaking, ensuring reliable communication between system components.

An API gateway serves as the primary entry point for external systems, implementing request routing, protocol translation, and security policies. The gateway handles authentication and authorization through a combination of API keys, JWT tokens, and OAuth2 flows. Rate limiting is implemented at this layer, with configurable thresholds based on client identity and request patterns.
